1. Keep the Dockerfile in the project root folder

2. Delete the target folder
Rebuild the Project (after changing app.prop file to point to postgres docker container)
using Maven clean install

3. Run the below command to build an image
docker build -t ccvalidationimage .

4. Check the newly created image
docker images

5. Run the image giving a container name (and exposing the port at 8050) :
docker run --name ccValidationContainer -p 8020:6060 ccvalidationimage

8020 = is the port where you access rest end points giving URL in postman
6060 = is the port of spring boot application (application.properties)
The above command will also start the web application server

Test the application by hitting the rest end point from postman
